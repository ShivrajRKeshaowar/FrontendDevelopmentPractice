# FrontendDevelopmentPractice
The repository contains my practice work in learning front-end development. Some of the pages are converted from psd designs to webpages and while making others I tried to learn the interaction between the html elements and how to change their behaviour according to our need using css or javascript. The practice gave a good insight of thses languages.
