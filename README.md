# FrontendDevelopmentPractice
The repository contains my practice work in learning front-end development. Some of the pages are converted from psd designs to webpages and while making others I tried to learn the interaction between the html elements and how to change their behaviour according to our need using css or javascript. The practice gave a good insight of thses languages.

NOTE :- The repository contains only the practice work no live projects.  For my live projects please refer the repositories that I am contributing in "Data-Audit and GeoFilming" as for now.
